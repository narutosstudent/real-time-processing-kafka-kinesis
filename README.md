# Real Time Data Streaming with Kafka and Kinesis

I previously built a [Batch Processing system: S3 -> AWS Glue -> Snowflake](https://github.com/narutosstudent/aws-glue-etl-snowflake).

This time, I wanted to build a Real Time Data Streaming system using Kafka and Kinesis.

I've always heard of Kafka and it's wide spread usage. Plus, it was a nice fit because I wanted to build a real time data streaming system.

# Pre Study

I did some [pre study](https://github.com/narutosstudent/kafka-kinesis-notes) before embarking on this project.
