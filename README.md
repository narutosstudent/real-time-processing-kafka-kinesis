# Debugging stories

- AWS MSK taking forever, 30 mins, not a bug, but that's expected, it needs to setup the VPC, subnets, etc.

- bootstrap brokers not outputting
- timeboxed it, went overtime lol
- couldnt figure it out
- grabbed it from the CLI "aws kafka get-bootstrap-brokers --cluster-arn <Cluster ARN>
- GPT, Perplexity, Google, Github Search and Github issues of terraform aws provider. Couldn't figure it out hahaaha lol

- script not working, had to set public ip address in the security group
